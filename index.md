# Welcome at
## Lucas Müllner's - Homepage


Hi there, I am glad to see you reached my personal website.

Let me briefly introduce myself, as well as you to my homepage. I am a guy who just graduated from the secondary technical college in Salzburg. My main goal is to improve myself and grow as figure in as many areas as possible. I have always been fascinated by different disciplines of science like maths or physics. During my education I figured out that I am very into computer science, especially software development.

Besides I am about to launch my first online shop with a friend of mine. There is still a lot of work to do but we are confident and doing our best to get this thing running.
We would appreciate it and be very grateful, if you checked it out.

Nevertheless, let's get back to computer science. As a software developer you need to be able to access your sources, projects and documentations as fast as possible, in order to develop whenever and wherever you like. Therefore, I created a GitHub account some time ago, in which I put everything concerning computer science.

Subsequent you find links which direct you to my GitHub repositories. Please note that my [Wiki](https://github.com/cleanCoder1999/Wiki) repository is not a common repository. It acts as a wiki where I document many different topics of computer science.
